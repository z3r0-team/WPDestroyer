# Mass WordPress Installer & Setup Tool
This is a powerful and concurrent Go-based tool designed to automate the process of installing and setting up WordPress on a massive scale. It intelligently scans a list of websites, detects vulnerable installation pages (install.php) and database setup pages (setup-config.php), and attempts to perform an automated installation using credentials you provide.

The tool is built for efficiency, utilizing Goroutines for high-speed, parallel processing, and provides clear, color-coded feedback directly in your console.

# ‚ú® Key Features
‚ö° High-Speed & Concurrent: Utilizes Go's concurrency model with configurable workers to scan and process hundreds or thousands of sites in a very short amount of time.

üß† Smart Detection: Automatically follows redirects to find the correct install.php or setup-config.php pages, maximizing the chances of a successful installation.

ü§ñ Fully Automated Installation:

Completes the standard 2-step WordPress installation process.

Automatically configures the database (wp-config.php) if a setup-config.php page is found.

‚úÖ Clean & Organized Reporting:

installed-wp.txt: A clean list of successfully installed sites with their corresponding credentials.

trymanually.txt: A dedicated list for sites where an installation page was found but the automated process failed, preventing duplicate checks and saving time.

‚öôÔ∏è Flexible Modes:

Interactive Mode: A user-friendly prompt for beginners to provide file paths and settings.

Command-Line Mode: Directly pass arguments for easy integration into automated workflows.

üöÄ First-Time Setup: If no .env file is found, the script initiates an interactive setup to securely create one for your credentials, making it easy to get started.

üé® Rich Console Output: Enjoy a colorful, well-structured, and informative console output that makes it easy to track the tool's progress.

# üõ†Ô∏è Usage
This guide covers how to run the pre-built executable on both Linux and Windows.

1. Configuration
The tool uses a .env file to store your credentials. Place the executable in a directory. On the first run, the tool will guide you to create a .env file, or you can create it manually in the same directory.

Create a file named .env and fill it with your desired credentials:

# WordPress Installation Credentials
BLOG_TITLE=My New Awesome Blog
USERNAME=admin
PASSWORD=YourSecurePasswordHere
EMAIL=your-email@example.com

# Database Setup Credentials
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=wordpress_db
DB_USERNAME=wp_user
DB_PASSWORD=YourSecureDbPassword

2. Prepare Your Lists
In the same directory as the executable, create the following files:

A sites.txt file with one domain per line (e.g., example.com).

A paths.txt file with one path per line (e.g., /blog, /wp).

3. Running the Tool
You have two options for running the executable:

A) Interactive Mode (Recommended for ease of use)

Simply run the program without any arguments. It will prompt you for the file paths and the number of workers.

For Linux:

./wp-installer-linux

For Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):

.\wp-installer.exe

B) Command-Line Mode (For automation)

Provide the paths to your sites and paths files as arguments.

For Linux:

# Usage: ./wp-installer-linux <sites_file> <paths_file> [worker_count]
./wp-installer-linux sites.txt paths.txt 50

For Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):

# Usage: .\wp-installer.exe <sites_file> <paths_file> [worker_count]
.\wp-installer.exe sites.txt paths.txt 50

# üí° How It Works
The tool takes a list of websites and a list of common paths (e.g., /blog, /wp) as input.

It creates a job queue of all possible site/path combinations.

Multiple concurrent workers pick jobs from the queue.

Each worker checks if the URL redirects to a WordPress installation or setup page.

If a vulnerable page is found:

It first attempts to configure the database if needed (setup-config.php).

It then proceeds to perform the final WordPress installation with the provided user details.

Results are logged to the appropriate output files (installed-wp.txt or trymanually.txt). The internal state ensures no site is ever processed twice.
