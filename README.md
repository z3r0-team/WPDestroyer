# Mass WordPress Installer & Setup Tool

This is a powerful and concurrent Go-based tool designed to automate the process of installing and setting up WordPress on a massive scale. It intelligently scans a list of websites, detects vulnerable installation pages (install.php) and database setup pages (setup-config.php), and attempts to perform an automated installation using credentials you provide.

The tool is built for efficiency, utilizing Goroutines for high-speed, parallel processing, and provides clear, color-coded feedback directly in your console.


## Features

- âš¡ High-Speed & Concurrent: Utilizes Go's concurrency model with configurable workers to scan and process hundreds or thousands of sites in a very short amount of time.

- ðŸ§  Smart Detection: Automatically follows redirects to find the correct install.php or setup-config.php pages, maximizing the chances of a successful installation.

- ðŸ¤– Fully Automated Installation: Completes the standard 2-step WordPress installation process. Automatically configures the database (wp-config.php) if a setup-config.php page is found.

- Interactive Mode: A user-friendly prompt for beginners to provide file paths and settings.

- Command-Line Mode: Directly pass arguments for easy integration into automated workflows.

- ðŸš€ First-Time Setup: If no .env file is found, the script initiates an interactive setup to securely create one for your credentials, making it easy to get started
